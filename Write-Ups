My write-ups of understanding of all Bandit levels in OverTheWire.

OverTheWire Bandit: The Shell Odyssey

    "He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you." — Nietzsche

Prologue: The Threshold

Level 0

The Directive: We stand at the gate. The first step is not to conquer, but to enter. We must establish a connection to the host bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220.

The Execution:


# Initiating the handshake
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Credential: bandit0

Part I: The Basics of Existence
Level 0 → 1: The Readme

Concept: The truth is often hidden in plain sight. 
Execution:


bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
# Password retrieved

Level 1 → 2: The Dash

Concept: A filename that defies convention requires a specific path to be acknowledged. 
Execution:


bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ ./- # referencing the current directory explicitly

Level 2 → 3: The Void Between Words

Concept: Handling the spaces that divide us—or in this case, the filename. 
Execution:


bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Level 3 → 4: The Hidden

Concept: Just because it is unseen does not mean it is absent. We must look closer. 
Execution:


bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la # Reveal the hidden dotfiles
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden

Level 4 → 5: The Human Element

Concept: Amidst the binary noise, we seek the only thing that speaks our language: ASCII text. 
Execution:


bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./* | grep "text"
./-file07: ASCII text
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07

Level 5 → 6: The Specificity of Being

Concept: The target has defined properties: human-readable, exactly 1033 bytes, and non-executable. We filter the world to find it. 
Execution:


bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

Level 6 → 7: Ownership

Concept: Identity defines access. We search for a file owned by bandit7, grouped by bandit6, exactly 33 bytes in size. 
Execution:


bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Level 7 → 8: The Millionth Iteration

Concept: Sifting through the repetition to find the one line that matters. 
Execution:


bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep "millionth"

Level 8 → 9: The Unique Soul

Concept: In a sea of duplicates, individuality is the key. 
Execution:


bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u

Level 9 → 10: The Strings of Fate

Concept: Extracting readable meaning from a binary blob, marked by the sign of equality. 
Execution:


bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "=.*"
# Locate the password preceded by several '=' characters

Part II: Transformation & Encryption
Level 10 → 11: Decoding Base64

Concept: The text has been obscured by encoding. We must reverse the process to see clearly. 
Execution:


bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | base64 -d

Level 11 → 12: The Rotated Cipher

Concept: A simple shift in perspective (ROT13) reveals the message. 
Execution:


bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

Level 12 → 13: The Onion

Concept: A relentless deconstruction of layers—hexdumps, gzip, bzip2, and tar. We peel back the compression until the core is exposed. 
Execution:


# Setup workspace
mkdir /tmp/mikka && cd /tmp/mikka
cp ~/data.txt .

# Deconstruction sequence
xxd -r data > binary
mv binary binary.gz
gzip -d binary.gz
bzip2 -d binary
mv binary.out binary.gz
gzip -d binary.gz
tar -xf binary
tar -xf data5.bin
bzip2 -d data6.bin 2>/dev/null
tar -xf data6.bin.out
mv data8.bin data8.gz
gzip -d data8.gz
cat data8

Level 13 → 14: The Private Key

Concept: Possession of the key grants entry. We use the private SSH key to assume the identity of the next user. 
Execution:


bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

Level 14 → 15: The Socket

Concept: Submitting our current knowledge to the local port to receive the next truth. 
Execution:


bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc 127.0.0.1 30000
# Submit current password -> Receive next password

Level 15 → 16: The Secure Channel

Concept: Same destination, but the path now requires encryption (SSL/TLS). 
Execution:


bandit15@bandit:~$ ncat -C --ssl 127.0.0.1 30001
# Submit current password

Level 16 → 17: The Port Scan

Concept: We must map the territory to find the listener. Only one port speaks SSL and offers the credentials. 
Execution:


# Mapping the ports
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p 31000-32000 127.0.0.1

# Connecting to the open SSL port
bandit16@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect 127.0.0.1:31790

# Capturing the RSA Key
mkdir /tmp/mikka && cd /tmp/mikka
nano id_rsa # (Paste key here)
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa bandit17@localhost

Part III: The System's Logic
Level 17 → 18: The Difference

Concept: Change is the only constant. We compare the old and the new to find the deviation. 
Execution:


bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new

Level 18 → 19: The Forced Exit

Concept: The system tries to silence us upon entry (.bashrc logout). We must execute our command before the door closes. 
Execution:


ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 'cat ~/readme'

Level 19 → 20: The Power of Setuid

Concept: Assuming the identity of another binary to access what is forbidden to us. 
Execution:


bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

Level 20 → 21: The Listener

Concept: We become the server. We open a port, listen, and verify the connection. 
Execution:


# Run listener in background
echo "[Current Password]" | netcat -lp 4444 &
# Trigger the connection
./suconnect 4444

Level 21 → 22: The Cron Job

Concept: Observing the automated heartbeat of the system. 
Execution:


cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

Level 22 → 23: The MD5 Target

Concept: We must think like the machine. The script generates a target filename based on the user's identity. We calculate where bandit23's file will be. 
Execution:


# Calculate the hash for the next user
echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
# Read the resulting file
cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

Level 23 → 24: The Script Injection

Concept: Creating our own logic. We write a script, plant it in the scheduler's path, and wait for the system to execute our will. 
Execution:


mkdir /tmp/mikkalevel24 && cd /tmp/mikkalevel24
nano script.sh

# Script Content:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/mikkalevel24/bandit24

chmod +x script.sh
chmod 777 . 
cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24
# Wait for cron execution...
cat bandit24

Level 24 → 25: The Brute Force

Concept: When the key is unknown, we try every possible permutation. A daemon requires a PIN; we provide them all. 
Execution:


mkdir /tmp/mikkalevel25 && cd /tmp/mikkalevel25
nano script.sh

# Loop through 0000-9999
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}; do
    echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ" $i >> passwords
done

chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
cat passwords | nc localhost 30002 >> result
cat result | grep 'The password'

Level 25 → 26: The Shell Escape

Concept: The environment is a prison (custom shell). We break the boundaries by abusing the pager (more) to spawn a true shell. 
Execution:


# Minimize terminal window to force 'more' into pagination
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@127.0.0.1
# In 'more', press 'v' to launch vim
# In vim:
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
# Freedom attained.
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

Level 26 → 27: The Escalation

Concept: Using the tools at hand to read the forbidden file. 
Execution:


./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27

Part IV: The Git Repository
Level 27 → 28: The Clone

Concept: The password lies within the version history. 
Execution:


mkdir /tmp/mikkalevel27 && cd /tmp/mikkalevel27
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo
cat repo/README

Level 28 → 29: The History

Concept: Nothing is ever truly deleted in Git. We check the logs to find what was "fixed." 
Execution:


git log
# Identify the commit where "missing data" was added or leaked
git checkout c086d11a00c0648d095d04c089786efef5e01264
cat README.md

Level 29 → 30: The Branch

Concept: The truth is not in the master branch, but in the development timeline. 
Execution:


git branch -r 
git checkout dev
cat README.md

Level 30 → 31: The Tag

Concept: A specific point in time marked as 'secret'. 
Execution:


git tag
git show secret

Level 31 → 32: The Push

Concept: We must contribute to the repository to receive the reward. We push a file, but the remote rejects us—revealing the password in the error message. 
Execution:


echo 'May I come in?' > key.txt
rm .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m 'Added key.txt'
git push origin master
# Password found in the remote rejection message

Level 32 → 33: The Final Escape

Concept: A "restrictive shell" that mimics uppercase. We invoke the variable $0 to call the shell by its true name. 
Execution:


WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> $0
$ whoami
bandit33
